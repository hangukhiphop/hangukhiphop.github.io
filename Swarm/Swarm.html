			Swarm is a 3D action Multiplayer Online Battle Areana (MOBA). 
		</br>
		</br>
			It is currently being developed under USC Gamepipe's Advanced Game Projects (AGP). 
		</br>
		</br>
			I originated the concept, and successfully pitched it to AGP during the spring of 2015 with a team of engineers and artists. 
		
			The process included a
			<a href="SwarmAGPPitch.pdf"> 
				Written pitch 
			</a>
			and a 
			<a href="SwarmAGPPitch.pptx"> 
				Pitch presentation.
			</a>
		</br>
		</br>
			My role in the project is creative director. I design the characters, mechanics, worlds, etc. and document them. My first task was to write the
			<a href="SwarmGDD.pdf">
				Game Design Document,
			</a>
			which summarizes the primary aspects of the game design.			
			I constantly collaborate with engineers and artists to develop game mechanics and assets according to design. 
			Furthermore, I iteratively ensure that the resulting gameplay is conducive to the optimal player experience.
